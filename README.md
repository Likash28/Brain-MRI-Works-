# Unveiling the Wonders of Brain MRI 🧠🌟

Welcome to the realm of Brain MRI segmentation, where cutting-edge technology meets the intricate world of medical imaging! 📸

In this fascinating journey, we harness the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the superheroes of deep learning, to meticulously identify and classify various brain regions and structures within MRI scans. 🦸‍♂️💻

Our mission? To revolutionize medical diagnostics and research, saving time for healthcare professionals and advancing our understanding of neurological conditions. 🏥📊

🌌 With CNNs at our side, we navigate the complexities of brain tissues, differentiating between gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. The result? Early detection of neurological disorders, disease progression monitoring, and the formulation of precise treatment plans. 🌡️🧪

🧲 But that's not all! We're on a quest to combat brain tumors, those mysterious growths of abnormal cells that demand accurate identification and assessment. 🦠

To tackle this formidable challenge, we embark on a unique journey in brain tumor classification and estimate the affected percentage within MRI scans. Our arsenal includes a deep learning model, a blend of CNN, and the mighty ResNet50. 🤖📈

We proudly sift through a vast dataset of brain MRI images, categorizing tumors into four distinct groups: meningioma, pituitary, glioma, and non-tumor. 🧬📝

Our endeavors bear fruit with an astonishing level of accuracy in tumor classification, a game-changer for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning. 🎮🌡️

🖼️ The magic continues as we employ image processing techniques to gauge the affected percentage. We take an uploaded MRI scan, transform it to grayscale, and unleash the power of the DeepLab3v+ algorithm for picture segmentation.

🖌️✂️ The contours of the tumor region emerge, highlighted for precision. By comparing the proportion of tumor pixels to all others, we unveil the exact impacted percentage. 💯📊

The applications are boundless. From early detection and diagnosis to treatment planning and the implementation of Automated Triage in Healthcare Systems, our journey is a testament to the potential of technology in the world of medicine. 🏥🚀🌐

Join us as we explore the frontiers of medical imaging, saving lives, and expanding our horizons in the realm of healthcare and technology. 🌠🧠
