**Brain MRI segmentation using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier is a cutting-edge medical imaging technique that leverages deep learning to precisely identify and categorize different regions and structures within brain MRI scans. This sophisticated technology plays a pivotal role in medical diagnostics and research. By utilizing CNNs, which are adept at learning intricate patterns in images, the classifier can accurately distinguish between various brain tissues, such as gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. This segmentation process not only aids in the early detection of neurological disorders but also facilitates the monitoring of disease progression and the planning of treatment strategies. The CNN classifier's ability to automate and enhance the accuracy of brain MRI segmentation not only saves time for medical professionals but also contributes significantly to improved patient care and our understanding of neurological conditions. Brain tumors are the growth of abnormal cells in the brain or nearby areas and require accurate identification and assessment for effective treatment. To prevent the extensive cause of brain tumors, detecting and identifying the location and extension of the brain tumor regions is essential. Therefore it is necessary to perform brain tumor classification and segmentation. This work involves a unique approach to brain tumor classification and estimation of the affected percentage in brain MRI scans. In this work, a deep learning model was developed using the sequential model with CNN and ResNet50. A vast dataset of brain MRI images is used for classifying brain tumors into four distinct groups: meningioma, pituitary, glioma, and non-tumor. This approach achieved a remarkable level of accuracy in tumor classification. It uses image processing techniques to estimate the affected percentage. The system converts an uploaded MRI scan to grayscale and uses the DeepLab3v+ algorithm for picture segmentation. The tumor region's most prominent contour is then picked out and highlighted. By comparing the proportion of tumor pixels to all other pixels of the image, the impacted percentage is determined. The classification of brain tumor disease has diverse applications, encompassing early detection and diagnosis, treatment planning, and the implementation of Automated Triage in Healthcare Systems.**
